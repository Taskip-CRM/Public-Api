# Authentication

The TaskIP API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the TaskIP Dashboard.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign in to your TaskIP account
2. Navigate to the API section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store your API key securely

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in all API requests using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://api.taskip.com/v1/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never expose your API keys in client-side code
- Rotate your API keys regularly
- Use environment variables to store API keys
- Implement IP whitelisting when possible
